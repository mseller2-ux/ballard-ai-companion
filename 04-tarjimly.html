    <h1>Tarjimly: AI-Enhanced Translation Platform for Refugee Communication and Emergency Language Access</h1>

    <h2>Background and Context</h2>
    <p class="indent">Language barriers represent one of the most significant challenges facing refugees and displaced populations as they navigate complex systems for accessing healthcare, legal services, employment, and essential social services. Traditional translation services are often unavailable, prohibitively expensive, or inadequate for the urgent, high-stakes communication needs that characterize refugee experiences.</p>

    <p class="indent">The global refugee crisis has created unprecedented demand for translation services, with over 100 million forcibly displaced people worldwide speaking hundreds of different languages and dialects. Existing solutions, including professional interpreting services and basic translation apps, fail to address the unique requirements of refugee communication, including cultural sensitivity, emotional support, and availability during crisis situations.</p>

    <p class="indent">Tarjimly emerged from the personal experience of its founders, who recognized that technology could be leveraged to connect willing volunteers with individuals in desperate need of communication support. The platform's development was guided by the principle that artificial intelligence should enhance rather than replace human empathy and cultural understanding in addressing humanitarian challenges.</p>

    <h2>Problem Definition: Love the One</h2>
    <p class="indent">The "Love the One" phase emphasized developing deep understanding of individual refugee experiences with language barriers and communication challenges. Extensive fieldwork and interviews revealed the profound personal impact of being unable to communicate basic needs, navigate bureaucratic systems, or access emergency services due to language barriers.</p>

    <p class="indent">Primary stakeholders included refugees and asylum seekers from diverse linguistic backgrounds, volunteer translators and interpreters, humanitarian organizations providing direct services, healthcare providers serving refugee populations, and legal aid organizations assisting with immigration proceedings. Each stakeholder group provided unique insights into the multifaceted nature of communication challenges in refugee contexts.</p>

    <p class="indent">Deep empathy research revealed that communication barriers created not only practical obstacles but also psychological trauma, social isolation, and systemic exclusion from essential services. These insights shaped the development of a platform designed to preserve dignity, cultural sensitivity, and human connection while leveraging technology for scale and efficiency.</p>
